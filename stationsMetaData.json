James' recordings as Aphex Twin brought him more critical praise than any other electronic artist during the 1990s. Though his first major single, \"Didgeridoo,\" was a piece of acid thrash designed to tire dancers during his DJ sets, ambient stylists and critics later took him under their wing for Selected Ambient Works 85-92, a sublime touchstone in the field of ambient techno. James' reaction to the exposure portrayed an artist unwilling to become either pigeonholed or categorizable. His second Aphex Twin album, Selected Ambient Works, Vol. 2, was so minimal as to be barely conscious -- in what appeared to be an elaborate joke on the electronic community. Follow-ups showed James gradually returning to his hardcore and acid roots, even while his stated desire to crash the British Top Ten (and perform on Top of the Pops) resulted in a series of cartoonish pop songs whose twisted genius was near-masked by their many absurdities. His iconoclastic behavior surprisingly aligned with MTV audiences turned on to end-of-the-millennium nihilist pop along the lines of Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails.\n\nJames began taking apart electronics gear as a teenager growing up in Cornwall, England. (If the title Selected Ambient Works 85-92 is to be believed, it contains recordings made at the age of 14.) Inspired by acid house in the late '80s, James began DJing raves around Cornwall. His first release was the Analogue Bubblebath EP, recorded with Tom Middleton and released on the Mighty Force label in September 1991. Middleton left later that year to form Global Communication, after which James recorded a second volume in the Analogue Bubblebath series. This EP (the first to include \"Digeridoo\") got some airplay on the London pirate radio station Kiss FM, and prompted Belgium's R&S Records to sign him early the following year. A re-recording of \"Digeridoo\" made number 55 in the British charts just after its April 1992 release date, and James followed with the Xylem Tube EP in June. He also co-formed (with Grant Wilson-Claridge) his own Rephlex label around that time, releasing a series of singles as Caustic Window during 1992-1993. Available in cruelly limited editions, most of the recordings continued the cold acid precision of \"Digeridoo\" -- though several expressed humor and fragility barely dreamed of in the hardcore/rave scene to that point.\n\nThe climate for \"intelligent\" techno had begun to warm in the early '90s, though. The Orb had proved the commercial viability of ambient house with their chart-topping \"Blue Room\" single, and R&S scrambled to find useful material from its own artists. In November 1992, James acquiesced with Selected Ambient Works 85-92, consisting mostly of home material recorded during the past few years. Simply stated, it was a masterpiece of ambient techno, the genre's second work of brilliance after the Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld. As his star began to shine, several bands approached him to remix their work, and he complied, with mostly unrecognizable reworkings of tracks by St. Etienne, the Cure, Jesus Jones, Meat Beat Manifesto, and Curve.\n\nEarly in 1993, Richard James signed to Warp Records, the influential British label that virtually introduced the concept of futuristic \"electronic listening music\" with a series of albums (subtitled \"Artificial Intelligence\") by ambient techno pioneers Black Dog, Autechre, B12, and FUSE (aka Richie Hawtin) among others. James' release in the series, titled Surfing on Sine Waves, was recorded as Polygon Window and released in January 1993. The album charted a course between the raw muscle of James' nose-bleed techno and the understated minimalism of Selected Ambient Works. A deal between Warp and TVT gave Surfing on Sine Waves an American release (James' first) by the summer. A second album was released that year, Analogue Bubblebath 3, for Rephlex. Recorded as AFX, the LP renounced any debt to ambient music and was the most bracing work yet in the Aphex Twin canon. On a tour of America with Orbital and Moby later that year, James clung to the headbanging material, to the detriment of his mostly unreplaceable gear. He later cut down on his live performance schedule.\n\nIn December of 1993, the new single \"On\" resulted in James' highest chart placing, a number 32 spot on the British charts. The two-part single included remixes by old pal Tom Middleton (as Reload) and future Rephlex star \u00b5-Ziq. Despite James' appearance on the pop charts, his following album, Selected Ambient Works, Vol. 2, appeared to be a joke on the ambient techno community. So minimal as to be barely conscious, the quadruple album left most of the beats behind, with only tape loops of unsettling ambient noise remaining. The album mostly struck out with critics but hit number 11 on the British charts and earned James a major-label American contract with Sire soon afterward. During 1994, he worked on the ever-growing Rephlex stable, signing \u00b5-Ziq (Michael Paradinas), Kosmik Kommando (Mike Dred), and Kinesthesia/Cylob (Chris Jeffs) to the label. In August 1994, he released the fourth \"Analogue Bubblebath\", this one a five-track EP.\n\nThe year 1995 began with the January release of Classics, a compilation of his early R&S singles. Two months later, James released the single \"Ventolin,\" a harsh, appropriately wheezing ode to the asthma drug on which he relied. I Care Because You Do followed in April, pairing his hardcore experimentalism with more symphonic ambient material, aligned with the work of many post-classical composers -- including Philip Glass, who arranged an orchestral version of the album's \"Icct Hedral\" on the August 1995 single Donkey Rhubarb.\n\nLater that year, the Hangable Auto Bulb EP replaced Analogue Bubblebath 3 as Aphex Twin's most brutal, uncompromising release -- a fusion of experimental music and jungle being explored at the same time on releases by Plug and Squarepusher. In July 1996, Rephlex released the long-awaited collaboration between Richard James and Michael Paradinas (\u00b5-Ziq). The album, Expert Knob Twiddlers (credited to Mike & Rich), watered down the experimentalism of Aphex Twin with \u00b5-Ziq's easy-listening electro-funk. The fourth proper Aphex Twin album, November 1996's Richard D. James Album, continued his forays into acid-jungle and experimental music. Retaining the experimental edge, but with a stated wish to make the British pop charts, James' next two releases, 1997's Come to Daddy EP and 1999's Windowlicker EP, were acid storms of industrial drum'n'bass. The accompanying videos, both directed by Chris Cunningham, featured the bodies of small children and female models (respectively) dancing around, all with special-effects-created Aphex Twin faces grinning maniacally.\n\nJames released nothing during the year 2000, but did record the score to Flex, a Chris Cunningham short film exhibited as part of the Apocalypse exhibition at London's Royal Academy. With very little advance warning, another LP, Drukqs, finally arrived in late 2001. Although James continued making frequent DJ appearances, he released no more material until 2005, when Rephlex issued the first installment in a lengthy, 11-part series of 12\" singles titled \"Analord\". The singles' minimalist acid techno harked back to his Caustic Window/\"Analogue Bubblebath\" material of the early '90s. Chosen Lords, a CD compilation of some of the \"Analord\" material, appeared in April 2006. James continued to DJ and play live, and in 2009 the Rushup Edge LP appeared under the performer name of the Tuss; although James and Rephlex denied that it was his work, rumors persisted that it was yet another Aphex pseudonym. Additional rumors during the late 2000s promised official releases from James, but they proved unfounded.\n\nJohn Bush, Rovi", "artistId": "Acirogtcm4nkyvhghrt3bguv3tu", "kind": "sj#artist", "name":

from making high-quality dub techno to releasing a singular and more adventurous strain with an approach that favored leaden tempos and unsettling, sample-based textures. From 2005 through 2011, Stott recorded exclusively for his hometown's Modern Love label, where he quickly became a key member of the roster alongside fellow travelers Claro Intelecto and Demdike Stare. He released a dozen singles and EPs, along with a taut 2006 album (Merciless) and a 2008 compilation (Unknown Exception). The producer made a significant creative advance in 2011 with a pair of creep-outs, Passed Me By and We Stay Together, that were combined and expanded for CD release by the end of the year. Stott also recorded some exceptional breakbeat-oriented dubstep as Andrea for Daphne, a Modern Love sublabel. In 2012, he released his third proper album, Luxury Problems, which incorporated vocals from Alison Skidmore, his former piano teacher.\n\nAndy Kellman, Rovi", "artistId": "Aeht7m2dkzdzcubeae3u4uj2wb4", "kind": "sj#artist", "name": "Andy Stott", "total_albums": 0}, "kind": "sj#radioSeedMetadata"}, "seedType": "3"}}, {"clientId": "Act2otazfhqc3pn7d55vtzuigfe", "deleted": false, "id": "ad5834c3-753e-309b-b598-d566a1ff7188", "imageUrl": "http://lh4.ggpht.com/pG0q5OmBzdM6bI1r1JCitDzZVon94nKtqiKJz-3gsAYZdM5lHtogEz8eLqHBn8fT41lEd4NBdQ", "imageUrls": [{"url": "http://lh4.ggpht.com/WdnaxLZUtFJRtbF2neUceT2jGt4maQ_fF5k3JRp48UW51oz3qWHma3a6hjMuU2_7FEMiBmTKdg"}, {"url": "http://lh4.ggpht.com/pG0q5OmBzdM6bI1r1JCitDzZVon94nKtqiKJz-3gsAYZdM5lHtogEz8eLqHBn8fT41lEd4NBdQ"}], "kind": "sj#radioStation", "lastModifiedTimestamp": "1383501874661039", "name": "Max Cooper", "recentTimestamp": "1382267088172000", "seed": {"artistId": "Act2otazfhqc3pn7d55vtzuigfe", "kind": "sj#radioSeed", "metadataSeed": {"artist": {"artistArtRef": "http://lh4.ggpht.com/WdnaxLZUtFJRtbF2neUceT2jGt4maQ_fF5k3JRp48UW51oz3qWHma3a6hjMuU2_7FEMiBmTKdg", "artistBio": "Scientific-minded electronic music producer Max Cooper makes music that spans from serene ambient techno to hard-hitting club bangers.

Despite serving double duties, he managed to put out a huge amount of material, releasing five EPs (One Is None, Crushbox, Harmonisch Serie, Stochastisch Serie, and InhaleExhale) and two full-lengths (FRANK and Symphonica) between 2007 and 2010. He then made the decision to pursue music full-time. He released five more EPs (Chaotisch Serie, Series, Expressions, Metaphysical, and Amalgamations) and a full-length (Ediolic Spectra) by the end of 2011. Cooper also managed to squeeze in some remix work, taking unique looks at songs by Au Revoir Simone, Sasha, Hot Chip, and Portishead. Continuing the breakneck pace, in 2012 he collaborated with visual artist Whiskas fX to make a run of experimental videos and put out yet another EP, Egomodal.\n\nJason Lymangrover, Rovi", "artistId": "Act2otazfhqc3pn7d55vtzuigfe", "kind": "sj#artist", "name": "Max Cooper", "total_albums": 0}, "kind": "sj#radioSeedMetadata"}, "seedType": "3"}}, {"clientId": "Amsfbuefz7fnz6ghh24exkia5zu", "deleted": false, "id": "8b1e01b1-cd3b-3742-ba79-f134b639669f", "imageUrl": "http://lh4.ggpht.com/-mIIK6L4vOS4shzcI1Vsw8mbuVOQFIzK065QakGkkVXMgtyjTTpsOnkHaz_H_pIMxY12gLUuxw", "imageUrls": [{"url": "http://lh6.ggpht.com/obed2Tju9MLrxhMUHXBFrhKgk0yMOoUbLW9Gc_vz0dEJHztpM_nZgvKPgjyYgKTz26wPlLCWVA"}, {"url": "http://lh4.ggpht.com/-mIIK6L4vOS4shzcI1Vsw8mbuVOQFIzK065QakGkkVXMgtyjTTpsOnkHaz_H_pIMxY12gLUuxw"}], "kind": "sj#radioStation", "lastModifiedTimestamp": "1384092344048774", "name": "Arovane", "recentTimestamp": "1382386537897000", "seed": {"artistId": "Amsfbuefz7fnz6ghh24exkia5zu", "kind": "sj#radioSeed", "metadataSeed": {"artist": {"artistArtRef": "http://lh6.ggpht.com/obed2Tju9MLrxhMUHXBFrhKgk0yMOoUbLW9Gc_vz0dEJHztpM_nZgvKPgjyYgKTz26wPlLCWVA", "artistBio": "Berlin's Uwe Zahn released his first tracks as the Arovane EP on the Din label, which also released the first of German dub minimalist Stefan Betke's work as Pole. Stylistically, Arovane's work hearkens back to the insular melodic electro of early Autechre, combining interesting, highly syncopated machine box rhythms with warm, delicate synth textures that evoke a gauzy, somewhat nostalgic mood contrasted by the sharpness of the rhythms. Indeed, while Autechre's Amber has become a touchpoint of sorts for a whole new generation of laptop do-it-yourselfers whose music rarely rises above tribute, Zahn's Arovane work is a legitimate extension of an aesthetic left largely unfinished, and is some of the most interesting and accomplished music of its kind. Fans of Ae, Funkstorung, Higher Intelligence Agency, and Phoenecia take note. After the Arovane EP, two additional EPs for Din (Icol Diston, AMX) preceded the release of Arovane's LP debut, Atol Scrap. Later that year, Tides appeared on City Centre Offices.

Eventually growing bored with the fast tempos and repetitiveness of drum'n'bass, Tipper began to experiment with tempos -- leading to his debut album, The Critical Path, in 2000 on the Higher Ground/Sony label. During the making of the album, Tipper began to suffer from hearing damage due to the elaborate and booming stereo systems inside his cars. With the problem sorted out, Tipper returned a year later with his sophomore effort (and first for the Pandisc label), Tipper Presents Sound Off, which eventually led to tours of both Europe and America.\n\nGreg Prato, Rovi", "artistId": "Apnuwg5gnnts7bu6l3pkyevz2si", "kind": "sj#artist", "name": "Tipper", "total_albums": 0}, "kind": "sj#radioSeedMetadata"}, "seedType": "3"}}, {"clientId": "97685558-e0a3-3143-9b17-25d4a105eb9e", "deleted": false, "id": "d8a8583f-bd2e-3667-b8b0-31c48eae0f69", "imageUrl": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/B5mVotDiA-BFbwVNJ9sVGkpwDA-Q72iQ9-SCACEaGkGF_hlH38ISEtZ1QdFcU1F2roiOzTybZA", "imageUrls": [{"url": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/B5mVotDiA-BFbwVNJ9sVGkpwDA-Q72iQ9-SCACEaGkGF_hlH38ISEtZ1QdFcU1F2roiOzTybZA"}, {"url": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/B5mVotDiA-BFbwVNJ9sVGkpwDA-Q72iQ9-SCACEaGkGF_hlH38ISEtZ1QdFcU1F2roiOzTybZA"}], "kind": "sj#radioStation", "lastModifiedTimestamp": "1384784410909233", "name": "Deauville", "recentTimestamp": "1384737947965000", "seed": {"kind": "sj#radioSeed", "metadataSeed": {"kind": "sj#radioSeedMetadata", "track": {"album": "Tides", "albumArtRef": [{"url": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/B5mVotDiA-BFbwVNJ9sVGkpwDA-Q72iQ9-SCACEaGkGF_hlH38ISEtZ1QdFcU1F2roiOzTybZA"}], "albumArtist": "Arovane", "albumId": "h2ssrmqulbggbnxiuqeofjpmba", "artist": "Arovane", "artistId": ["msfbuefz7fnz6ghh24exkia5zu"], "clientId": "0fb0bf3f-300c-4d7d-802b-8dd494e02c67", "composer": "", "creationTimestamp": "1384419581028111", "deleted": false, "discNumber": 1, "durationMillis": "343000", "estimatedSize": "13725812", "genre": "Techno", "id": "97685558-e0a3-3143-9b17-25d4a105eb9e", "kind": "sj#track", "lastModifiedTimestamp": "1384419581028111", "nid": "y5j44anhhxcqo57ax45djg62xy", "playCount": 9, "recentTimestamp": "1384420247290000", "storeId": "Ty5j44anhhxcqo57ax45djg62xy", "title": "Deauville", "trackNumber": 8, "trackType": "8", "year": 2000}}, "seedType": "1", "trackLockerId": "97685558-e0a3-3143-9b17-25d4a105eb9e"}}, {"clientId": "A55qu2ii5n7wrrbxduoktr4nmua", "deleted": false, "id": "55cee3aa-ae8b-36b6-a120-d95871643573", "imageUrl": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/DkIHYlbnN0lXeYxxEtR6GR_8NU9lzRqlQeck2PcrxX6ZQCBTxvZAw7zTjhVouvJ0BRHAhZzTxQ", "imageUrls": [{"url": "http://lh6.ggpht.com/IzD6s5YtEJnxp4tRiY_afg5jnFZJjClE2my5tBUjkqDL3ke0WJEQ-Jnt2zLuqGgAIUoriMNs"}, {"url": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/DkIHYlbnN0lXeYxxEtR6GR_8NU9lzRqlQeck2PcrxX6ZQCBTxvZAw7zTjhVouvJ0BRHAhZzTxQ"}], "kind": "sj#radioStation", "lastModifiedTimestamp": "1385023739110179", "name": "Long Arm", "recentTimestamp": "1382280326205000", "seed": {"artistId": "A55qu2ii5n7wrrbxduoktr4nmua", "kind": "sj#radioSeed", "metadataSeed": {"artist": {"artistArtRef": "http://lh6.ggpht.com/IzD6s5YtEJnxp4tRiY_afg5jnFZJjClE2my5tBUjkqDL3ke0WJEQ-Jnt2zLuqGgAIUoriMNs", "artistId": "A55qu2ii5n7wrrbxduoktr4nmua", "kind": "sj#artist", "name": "Long Arm", "total_albums": 0}, "kind": "sj#radioSeedMetadata"}, "seedType": "3"}}, {"clientId": "Aghmn2jopq2pj2hrkzwjylwjlbm", "deleted": false, "id": "4b8ae5d8-4331-3717-9bbf-ca6d1ab70b77", "imageUrl": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/-ryisv6LKpRhDZ49KsTgSgWcvpWA3urilHEYEJhibg6FFCiakaKDJI7xjpwgn9GcTCg3Aw3avA", "imageUrls": [{"url": "http://lh4.ggpht.com/0mj6PQOhcyU0cmS3JIjEqbCJxobTTrKTe3mo_uaHNrJygZ4GmhcrN4tRpckamOOMfC9WzSxlfQ"}, {"url": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/-ryisv6LKpRhDZ49KsTgSgWcvpWA3urilHEYEJhibg6FFCiakaKDJI7xjpwgn9GcTCg3Aw3avA"}], "kind": "sj#radioStation", "lastModifiedTimestamp": "1385301885845367", "name": "Autechre", "recentTimestamp": "1385138683723000", "seed": {"artistId": "Aghmn2jopq2pj2hrkzwjylwjlbm", "kind": "sj#radioSeed", "metadataSeed": {"artist": {"artistArtRef": "http://lh4.ggpht.com/0mj6PQOhcyU0cmS3JIjEqbCJxobTTrKTe3mo_uaHNrJygZ4GmhcrN4tRpckamOOMfC9WzSxlfQ", "artistBio": "Like Aphex Twin, Autechre were about as close to being experimental techno superstars as the tenets of their genre and the limitations of their audience allowed. Through a series of full-length works and a smattering of EPs on Warp, Clear, and their own Skam label, Autechre consistently garnered the praise of press and public alike. Unlike many of their more club-bound colleagues, however, Autechre's Sean Booth and Rob Brown had roots planted firmly in American electro, and though the more mood-based, sharply digital texture of their update seemed to speak otherwise, it was through early 12\"s like Egyptian Lover's \"Egypt, Egypt,\" Grandmaster Flash's \"Scorpio,\" and \"Pretty\" Tony Butler's \"Get Some\" that their combined aesthetic began to form.\n\nBooth and Brown met through a mutual friend, trading junked-up pause-button mixtapes of their favorite singles back and forth. Happening onto some bargain basement analog gear through questionable circumstances, the pair began experimenting with their own music before they were out of high school. After some disastrous experiences with a few small labels, the pair sent a tape off to Warp Records, whose early releases by Sweet Exorcist, Nightmares on Wax, and B12 were announcing a new age in U.K.-based techno (and one in which Autechre would become a key component). Releasing a handful of early singles through the label, Autechre's first stabs were collected on their debut full-length, Incunabula, as well as the 10\" box set remix EP Basscadet.\n\nSubsequent albums reached a wider audience through stateside reissue, first on Wax Trax!/TVT, later on Nothing (the label managed by Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor), and finally through a stateside branch of Warp. Although stylistically rooted, affectations for the ponderous extend beyond their name and track titles (\"C/Pach,\" \"Bronchusevenmx24\"), with the basic premise of their approach being music without a whole lot of stylistic baggage but plenty of DSP'ed-to-death hyper-programming. Later albums Untilted (2005), Quaristice (2008), Oversteps (2010), Move of Ten (2010), and the two-hour Exai (2013) were not as groundbreaking, yet Autechre easily retained one of the most distinctive sounds in the world of electronica.\n\nIn addition to Autechre, Booth and Brown released material as Gescom on their own Skam imprint and through the Clear label, most notably the Sounds of Machines Our Parents Used EP on the latter. The group also provided a number of memorable remixes (oftentimes more memorable than the original material) for artists including Palmskin Productions, Slowly, Mike Ink, DJ Food, Scorn, Skinny Puppy, Tortoise, Phoenecia, Various Artists, the Black Dog, Apparat, and the Bug.\n\nSean Cooper, Rovi", "artistId": "Aghmn2jopq2pj2hrkzwjylwjlbm", "kind": "sj#artist", "name": "Autechre", "total_albums":

credited with some of the least predictable, categorization-defying electronic dance music of the 2000s. Since debuting in 2004 with the No Tricks 12\" on his own Werk Discs label, Cunningham juggled a diverse array of inspirations -- including early-'80s funk and electro, art rock, raw and clacissist house, and noise -- while putting a fresh, challenging spin on them. As a result, his productions confounded some DJs while also being devoured by others within the realms of house, techno, and dubstep. Cunningham released a pair of albums, the promising Hazyville (Werk, 2008) and the exceptional Splazsh (Honest Jon's, 2010), and remixed tracks by a select list of fellow producers including Kassem Mosse, Joy Orbison, Alex Smoke, and Panda Bear. At the same time, Werk Discs was one of the most revered dance labels -- a trusted outlet for the likes of Lone, Zomby, and Lukid.\n\nAndy Kellman, Rovi", "artistId": "Au3b7jqr4fnsqbbvwkuo26c6n3a", "kind": "sj#artist", "name": "Actress", "total_albums": 0}, "kind": "sj#radioSeedMetadata"}, "seedType": "3"}}, {"clientId": "Bizkam5bfse57op6o45hiw2xdyi", "deleted": false, "id": "d41e2554-2759-36aa-8771-5b6290004e35", "imageUrl": "http://lh4.ggpht.com/-ZJsMVnlRSklnKmJWiOGk0MVLA0pW3eB0U9uVu_5verf_GLbEsUfddV3pA6iYcpX6UdsIhdh", "imageUrls": [{"url": "http://lh4.ggpht.com/-ZJsMVnlRSklnKmJWiOGk0MVLA0pW3eB0U9uVu_5verf_GLbEsUfddV3pA6iYcpX6UdsIhdh"}, {"url": "http://lh4.ggpht.com/-ZJsMVnlRSklnKmJWiOGk0MVLA0pW3eB0U9uVu_5verf_GLbEsUfddV3pA6iYcpX6UdsIhdh"}], "kind": "sj#radioStation", "lastModifiedTimestamp": "1393738256497671", "name": "Among Others", "recentTimestamp": "1388653957001000", "seed": {"albumId": "Bizkam5bfse57op6o45hiw2xdyi", "kind": "sj#radioSeed", "metadataSeed": {"album": {"albumArtRef": "http://lh4.ggpht.com/-ZJsMVnlRSklnKmJWiOGk0MVLA0pW3eB0U9uVu_5verf_GLbEsUfddV3pA6iYcpX6UdsIhdh", "albumArtist": "Proem", "albumId": "Bizkam5bfse57op6o45hiw2xdyi", "artist": "Proem", "artistId": ["Az6iufasnwmv2pvqrv7efyd5hsu"], "kind": "sj#album", "name": "Among Others", "year": 2001}, "kind": "sj#radioSeedMetadata"}, "seedType": "4"}}, {"clientId": "Bvlk6xu5p7cgpuv5yrn5oa7dtti", "deleted": false, "id": "29d3bf14-5a95-35a9-806a-7ecb08815534", "imageUrl": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/9qTaaSAdoBLhCPSKapufPJa04Ge5Y89AfnZA4iC5XkknBmyjO-PYfE9y34mlvXHLYzAw6jyxiw", "imageUrls": [{"url": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/9qTaaSAdoBLhCPSKapufPJa04Ge5Y89AfnZA4iC5XkknBmyjO-PYfE9y34mlvXHLYzAw6jyxiw"}, {"url": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/9qTaaSAdoBLhCPSKapufPJa04Ge5Y89AfnZA4iC5XkknBmyjO-PYfE9y34mlvXHLYzAw6jyxiw"}], "kind": "sj#radioStation", "lastModifiedTimestamp": "1394536241857594", "name": "Sketches from New Brighton", "recentTimestamp": "1394536141194000", "seed": {"albumId": "Bvlk6xu5p7cgpuv5yrn5oa7dtti", "kind": "sj#radioSeed", "metadataSeed": {"album": {"albumArtRef": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/9qTaaSAdoBLhCPSKapufPJa04Ge5Y89AfnZA4iC5XkknBmyjO-PYfE9y34mlvXHLYzAw6jyxiw", "albumArtist": "loscil", "albumId": "Bvlk6xu5p7cgpuv5yrn5oa7dtti", "artist": "loscil", "artistId": ["Avibcmk2caqcomqwf57fsewtqc4"], "description": "Scott Morgan spent the two albums he made prior to Sketches from New Brighton, Endless Falls and Coast/Range/Arc, expanding on his subtle ambient approach. On this collection, however, he pulls in a bit, using the experience from those explorations to craft something just as rich as those albums in spite (or perhaps because) of its simplicity. As with all of Morgan's work, Sketches from New Brighton establishes a striking sense of place within its music, not just because it was inspired by an actual location -- in this case, an oceanside park near the Vancouver Port Authority -- but because it has so much depth. Over the course of the album, a handful of sounds combine in ways full of hushed beauty and creativity, emphasizing the sculptural nature of these tracks. \"Khanahmoot\" begins things with gentle but engaging gradations that prepare listeners for the more ambitious explorations to come. One of these is the eight-and-a-half-minute-long \"Second Narrows\" (whose name makes this album's connection to Loscil's 2004 album First Narrows more explicit). It's one of the most expansive showcases for Morgan's almost imperceptible shifts, as the dark pulse that makes up the album's heart is joined by delicately layered beats and synths that get more fractured and active as the song nears its close. On this song and the rest of Sketches from New Brighton, a watercolor softness and transparency to the sounds pull in listeners ever so gently and give an almost subliminally soothing effect to many of its tracks, such as \"Container Ships,\" which feels nearly amniotic in its weightless intimacy, or the lulling warmth of \"Coyote.\" However, not all of the album is so cozy: \"Hastings Sunrise\" boasts a sharply metallic tone that recalls a shakuhachi flute in its insistent loneliness, which envelops the rest of the track with a noir-ish glamour and mystery that make it all the more striking, and \"Collision of the Pacific Gatherer\"'s bassline adds an ominous undertone to the rippling electronics that overlay it. Yet these changes in mood are as subtle as everything else on the album; all the better to discover the different ways these songs flow into each other. Sketches from New Brighton may not be as immediately gripping as Endless Falls or Coast/Range/Arc, but its never-showy refinements are just as impressive in their own way.\n\nHeather Phares, Rovi", "kind": "sj#album", "name": "Sketches from New Brighton", "year": 2012}, "kind": "sj#radioSeedMetadata"}, "seedType": "4"}}, {"clientId": "A72pw5cdmgml3zki3rqgijjtuia", "deleted": false, "id": "9480246f-8db3-33c5-942e-9f288873a49b", "imageUrl": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/XXV3if_8Ay_OeSsiPq7M0Tzb0aZaOy4JP512eG6_b_cTR7H8_ztHXrbpH6ulqIurZthDYmenIgI", "imageUrls": [{"url": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/XXV3if_8Ay_OeSsiPq7M0Tzb0aZaOy4JP512eG6_b_cTR7H8_ztHXrbpH6ulqIurZthDYmenIgI"}], "kind": "sj#radioStation", "lastModifiedTimestamp": "1394970917522713", "name": "Current Value", "recentTimestamp": "1394970917519000", "seed": {"artistId": "A72pw5cdmgml3zki3rqgijjtuia", "kind": "sj#radioSeed", "seedType": "3"}}, {"clientId": "Bk4sdl34blnkvsww7csckxg2is4", "deleted": false, "id": "9bb63c32-5db6-3e9f-837e-eb07d7724cba", "imageUrl": "http://lh6.ggpht.com/VCgSk3N4l6mrTCGNPQ6_uHnBBIHLNp5PR_FyG_WDUA5-tDDyJk-z6hQafCQqwdrdmc7YwX7oEXE", "imageUrls": [{"url": "http://lh6.ggpht.com/VCgSk3N4l6mrTCGNPQ6_uHnBBIHLNp5PR_FyG_WDUA5-tDDyJk-z6hQafCQqwdrdmc7YwX7oEXE"}], "kind": "sj#radioStation", "lastModifiedTimestamp": "1395230951883758", "name": "BCD", "recentTimestamp": "1395230951881000", "seed": {"albumId": "Bk4sdl34blnkvsww7csckxg2is4", "kind": "sj#radioSeed", "seedType": "4"}}, {"clientId": "Aa6ee6q2uwpstgn2p6hjurbj35y", "deleted": false, "id": "31e199b8-25a5-31dd-bb34-e8dfe5948340", "imageUrl": "http://lh6.ggpht.com/gVASk-aG5YyTPupjlRlI3uDW2_bPEUsGQj3NF3lv8TOCXA_Ik6sScIwgOc-mFXbaecLyGa5yAsQ", "imageUrls": [{"url": "http://lh6.ggpht.com/gVASk-aG5YyTPupjlRlI3uDW2_bPEUsGQj3NF3lv8TOCXA_Ik6sScIwgOc-mFXbaecLyGa5yAsQ"}], "kind": "sj#radioStation", "lastModifiedTimestamp": "1395289451117652", "name": "Mogwai", "recentTimestamp": "1395289451114000", "seed": {"artistId": "Aa6ee6q2uwpstgn2p6hjurbj35y", "kind": "sj#radioSeed", "seedType": "3"}}, {"clientId": "Azuaqukxjfum7xoxoztbaoilcsi", "deleted": false, "id": "cb7bd9a1-adf7-3d77-8a61-d53040762859", "imageUrl": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/EMpYhBwBM9wkxyl7cx50UwqJUBFq8YnaNk5T8fgfGGnUfn6c-b-CjvKMTPwKEslxTqNeTkI8HQ", "imageUrls": [{"url": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/EMpYhBwBM9wkxyl7cx50UwqJUBFq8YnaNk5T8fgfGGnUfn6c-b-CjvKMTPwKEslxTqNeTkI8HQ"}, {"url": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/EMpYhBwBM9wkxyl7cx50UwqJUBFq8YnaNk5T8fgfGGnUfn6c-b-CjvKMTPwKEslxTqNeTkI8HQ"}], "kind": "sj#radioStation", "lastModifiedTimestamp": "1397378847073178", "name": "Jon Hopkins", "recentTimestamp": "1390197137962000", "seed": {"artistId": "Azuaqukxjfum7xoxoztbaoilcsi", "kind": "sj#radioSeed", "metadataSeed": {"artist": {"artistArtRef": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/EMpYhBwBM9wkxyl7cx50UwqJUBFq8YnaNk5T8fgfGGnUfn6c-b-CjvKMTPwKEslxTqNeTkI8HQ", "artistBio": "Jon Hopkins is an electronic producer who meticulously constructs lush arrangements, blending digital beats and soothing ambience. His unique, hypnotic style made him a sought-after producer in the pop world, and earned him credits on albums by Coldplay, Massive Attack, Brian Eno, and Herbie Hancock in the late 2000s. Starting out as a gifted child pianist, in his teen years he became interested in synthesized sounds and started making acid house and drum'n'bass on a four-track recorder using computer software. He signed to Just Music at the ripe age of 19 in 2001, and recorded his debut album, Opalescent, while working part-time as a studio session musician in Wembley. His next album, 2004's Contact Note, was slightly more cinematic in nature and gained the respect of Brian Eno, who recruited Hopkins to play keys on his 2005 comeback album, Another Day on Earth. Through Eno, Hopkins began working on Coldplay's Viva la Vida as a co-producer before he returned to his solo career to complete his 2009 album, Insides.\n\nJason Lymangrover, Rovi", "artistId": "Azuaqukxjfum7xoxoztbaoilcsi", "kind": "sj#artist", "name": "Jon Hopkins", "total_albums": 0}, "kind": "sj#radioSeedMetadata"}, "seedType": "3"}}, {"clientId": "Ad7t3ndmjfwlpyebu2wgk7vvyiu", "deleted": false, "id": "92ecd9c2-9060-3dbb-9335-36026286bf7b", "imageUrl": "http://lh4.ggpht.com/YPGJvyljEf4Gp5j_9HjKuCOEAAdUOH1LSXwIUtawm7HhmxCxPlxu3TjkSRItGIsPadlWKmmd", "imageUrls": [{"url": "http://lh4.ggpht.com/YPGJvyljEf4Gp5j_9HjKuCOEAAdUOH1LSXwIUtawm7HhmxCxPlxu3TjkSRItGIsPadlWKmmd"}], "kind": "sj#radioStation", "lastModifiedTimestamp": "1397899417944654", "name": "Billain", "recentTimestamp": "1397899417940000", "seed": {"artistId": "Ad7t3ndmjfwlpyebu2wgk7vvyiu", "kind": "sj#radioSeed", "seedType": "3"}}, {"clientId": "Tbxexcfofglnammofwthcsg6to4", "deleted": false, "id": "7f0be008-9ea1-3a23-a4ea-37e77fb40653", "imageUrl": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/rDI8aM4B2qSsRamgLlR3gtadkzLqdFhkkLVAZVoy9GS-emTwKNZm5zXe51FWd5h9InIa2w-A", "imageUrls": [{"url": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/rDI8aM4B2qSsRamgLlR3gtadkzLqdFhkkLVAZVoy9GS-emTwKNZm5zXe51FWd5h9InIa2w-A"}, {"url": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/rDI8aM4B2qSsRamgLlR3gtadkzLqdFhkkLVAZVoy9GS-emTwKNZm5zXe51FWd5h9InIa2w-A"}], "kind": "sj#radioStation", "lastModifiedTimestamp": "1398537915167052", "name": "Open Eye Signal", "recentTimestamp": "1398537914995000", "seed": {"kind": "sj#radioSeed", "metadataSeed": {"kind": "sj#radioSeedMetadata", "track": {"album": "Immunity", "albumArtRef": [{"url": "http://lh5.ggpht.com/rDI8aM4B2qSsRamgLlR3gtadkzLqdFhkkLVAZVoy9GS-emTwKNZm5zXe51FWd5h9InIa2w-A"}], "albumArtist": "Jon Hopkins", "albumAvailableForPurchase": true, "albumId": "khxqnedjnlpoq3kawfal3y5pbu", "artist": "Jon Hopkins", "artistId": ["zuaqukxjfum7xoxoztbaoilcsi", "wjq5j237i3oj2mvrrhokkcsgou"], "composer": "", "discNumber": 1, "durationMillis": "468000", "estimatedSize": "18746541", "genre": "Dance/Electronic", "kind": "sj#track", "nid": "bxexcfofglnammofwthcsg6to4", "playCount": 21, "rating": "5", "storeId": "Tbxexcfofglnammofwthcsg6to4", "title": "Open Eye Signal", "trackAvailableForPurchase": true, "trackNumber": 2, "trackType": "7", "year": 2013}}, "seedType": "2", "trackId": "Tbxexcfofglnammofwthcsg6to4"}}, {"clientId": "Bwpe6ugfowktlffmiolwui27aoe", "deleted": false, "id": "2d510e82-188d-3d6a-b7f1-56f12f15ff9f", "imageUrl": "http://lh4.ggpht.com/mXQwMf6QQTkkst39aUeL7u8xxxuCJx98eJQsGGYvRnrIaPLVrp-ayXp-S7AcbvRcIPsVKMxz-Q", "imageUrls": [{"url": "http://lh4.ggpht.com/mXQwMf6QQTkkst39aUeL7u8xxxuCJx98eJQsGGYvRnrIaPLVrp-ayXp-S7AcbvRcIPsVKMxz-Q"}, {"url": "http://lh4.ggpht.com/mXQwMf6QQTkkst39aUeL7u8xxxuCJx98eJQsGGYvRnrIaPLVrp-ayXp-S7AcbvRcIPsVKMxz-Q"}], "kind": "sj#radioStation", "lastModifiedTimestamp": "1398862863229785", "name": "Hitori + Kaiso (1998 - 2001)", "recentTimestamp": "1398862863219000", "seed": {"albumId": "Bwpe6ugfowktlffmiolwui27aoe", "kind": "sj#radioSeed", "metadataSeed": {"album": {"albumArtRef": "http://lh4.ggpht.com/mXQwMf6QQTkkst39aUeL7u8xxxuCJx98eJQsGGYvRnrIaPLVrp-ayXp-S7AcbvRcIPsVKMxz-Q", "albumArtist": "Casino Versus Japan", "albumId": "Bwpe6ugfowktlffmiolwui27aoe", "artist": "Casino Versus Japan", "artistId": ["A6uw723tn54jf7b5bdm6jkmah44"], "kind": "sj#album", "name": "Hitori + Kaiso (1998 - 2001)", "year": 2004}, "kind": "sj#radioSeedMetadata"}, "seedType": "4"}}]
